  storyText: I was born into a poor, peasant family in an outlying village. My mother
    would spend her days tending to the gardens, cooking, cleaning, and caring for
    my little sister and I. My father was a blacksmith, forging the best weaponry
    to the royal knights. He lived within castle walls, but did not earn enough to
    have our family in a proper home. He spent his nights sleeping on the Smithshop
    floor, with no proper bed. Only a thin cloth to keep himself warm.
