  storyText: Our entire village was in flames. A raider rushed over to me and attempted
    to grab me, but luckily, a man from my village came and saved me with his last
    breath. I rushed over back to my little sister and grabbed her hand. We ran as
    fast as we could towards the castle. I don't remember ever running so fast in
    my life. I felt so many emotions rushing through my mind. Anger, fear, sadness...
    all kinds of memories from my mother and our village. But I knew I had to be
    strong, for my sister's sake. This was only the beginning.
