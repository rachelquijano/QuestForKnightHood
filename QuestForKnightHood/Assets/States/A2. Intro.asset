  storyText: One day, my mother grew very ill. She requested that my sister and I
    deliver her goods to the castle. I was twelve at the time, and my little sister
    was ten. We were still very young, but we knew we had to do this for our mother,
    or we would not be able to afford to buy her the necessary medicine to begin
    her healing. As we were heading out of the village, raiders from a distant village
    invaded, destroying everything in their path. My little sister and I began to
    panic, we weren't really sure what we should do. I told my sister to hide behind
    a berry bush, and I attempted to rush over to our home and get my mother, but
    everything happened so fast that it was too late.
