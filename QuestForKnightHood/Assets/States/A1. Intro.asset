  storyText: My sister and I were just children at the time, unaware of the true
    hardships of  life. You see, we thought we had everything, as all children do.
    We had a roof over our heads, we had food and water, and most importantly, we
    had each other. We were an unbreakable family... for the most part. My sister
    and I would visit my father whenever my mother could take us into the castle
    for trading. With all her domestic work, she would also spend time sewing the
    most beautiful garments, which would be traded at the kingdom's square.
